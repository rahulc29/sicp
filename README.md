Solutions to the text ["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf), a text considered by many to be a part of the Biblical canon of computer science. 

I am currently in the process of studying the text and learning Scheme so the solutions will be unstable and may contain mistakes.

If you found any mistakes, please do file an issue. ðŸ¤¥

Happy scheming! ðŸ˜º
